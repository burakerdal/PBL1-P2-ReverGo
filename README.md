# PBL1-P2-ReverGo
Project: ReverGo The aim of the project is to develop a strategic board game for two players, played on a 1×16 or 8×8 board, in which the user plays against the computer and tries to reverse the stones' color into his/her color, so s/he will have more stone on the board for winning.
